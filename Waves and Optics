<strong>Course Description:</strong>
The first year of BSc (Hons) Course Structure is a mixture of the basic courses of maths, physics and chemistry that gives a solid foundation to  student in sciences. This Physics course will cover several basic Wave phenomena and Optics (5 units). The course material will be covered in traditional lecture format as well as powerpoint slides. Experiment demonstrations in class or in Physics Laboratory (E Block) will be done with focus on hands-on activities. (prereqs High school Physics and Maths).

<strong>Lectures:</strong>
Monday (10-50 - 11.45 am)
Tuesday (1-35 - 2.30 am)
wednesday (9.00 - 10.50 am)

<strong>Labs:</strong>
Demontrations only

<strong>GRADES:</strong>
Grades in this course will be assigned as follows:
<strong>External (100 Marks):</strong>
There will be one end of the semester final Exam Covering all 5 units.

<strong>Internal (40% Marks):</strong>

<strong>Sessional Exams</strong>
There will be two sessional exams. These exams will be scheduled out of class during the Sessional week. Please check QU Academic Calendar for specific dates.

<strong> Assignment/Tutorials</strong>
There are two assignments in this course. However, Homework and Tutorials will be handed out throughout the course and homework will not only cover material discussed in class but also help you prepare for the university Examination.
To get full marks for the assignment, homework needs to show understanding of the physical concepts, as well as knowledge of problem solving techniques.
Please Limit your collaboration with fellow students to general concepts, procedures about strategies for solving a problem. One has to produce their own work and any solution found copied will not be entertained.
Additionally, class participation will be judged as well

<strong>Class Participation</strong>
The students are expected to read the material before coming to class. Participation to in-class experiments/demonstrations will count as credit. Part of the homework will be directly linked to the in-class activities
